System requirements
-------------------

These compilation instructions have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 x64 only.

C++ compilers are memory-hungry, so it is recommended to have at least 1 GB of memory available when compiling TreasureLandCoin. With less memory, compilation may take much longer due to swapfile thrashing.
